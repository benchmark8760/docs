Intro
=====

**The Benchmark 8760 Platform** is an open-source solution for collecting hourly energy performance data from commercial buildings, and exploring new performance benchmarking methodologies.

The solution is deployed at the `Benchmark 8760 Proof of Concept Portal <https://benchmark8760.org/>`_ 
which is collecting and visualizing anonymous hourly performance data provided by project participants.

This documentation is aimed at engineers looking to deploy a copy of the Portal and project manufacturers looking to develop connectors to provide data to the platform. 
It is best read together with the general Platform Technical Documentation located `here <https://benchmark8760.org/Benchmark%208760%20Platform%20Technical%20Documentation.pdf>`_.
